Alex_H_CH5_p1_f32d969c		(I snap myself back to reality. There is no way that could possibly be the reason. We just met each other, we’re mere friends. There’s no way he would fall for someone like me, right...right?)	game/script_hong.rpy	601	"[what]"
Alex_H_CH5_p1_2d9d9b33	you	{i}Argh, I need to think about this more before I talk to him. {i}	game/script_hong.rpy	602	you "[what]"
Alex_H_CH5_p1_4481ad54		(I carefully scurry through my remaining classes, avoiding him once more. Whenever I catch brief glimpses of him in the hallways, I see his deeply distraught expression, which spoils his otherwise attractive facial features.)	game/script_hong.rpy	605	"[what]"

Alex_H_CH5_p1_59b4d6d8	bai	It’s his fault. You should know that. Stop being apologetic over something that wasn’t your fault.	game/script_hong.rpy	615	bai "[what]"
Alex_H_CH5_p1_9e4c86a2	you	That’s true... but I’ve been ignoring him recently. I haven’t really given him a chance to talk...	game/script_hong.rpy	617	you "[what]"
Alex_H_CH5_p1_0c7ebfb8	bai	No, but if he was really apologetic, he would bust down the doors and shout out his apology with a loudspeaker. The reason he’s hesitant is because he DOESN’T MEAN IT.	game/script_hong.rpy	618	bai "[what]"
Alex_H_CH5_p1_46acfd30	you	Alright, alright, lets not go there. I’m sure Alex H does feel guilty about this, and didn’t have bad intentions back then...	game/script_hong.rpy	619	you "[what]"

Alex_H_CH5_p2_5296c2a5		(Following his request, I noticed his face reverting back to an unreadable expression. While I spotted hints of nervousness, there was also an uncharacteristic desire within him that made his request hard to pass on.)	game/script_hong.rpy	673	"[what]"

Alex_H_ch6_p1_537500b6		(Without any further delay, he started playing. Years of hard work has made him masterful of the skill, as his fingers moved tenderly along the tiles of the piano, producing a majestic, rhythm.)	game/script_hong.rpy	711	"[what]"

Alex_H_ch6_p1_d5c307a2		The few seconds of ecstasy seem to last a lifetime, as we were alone in an empty room, sharing our moment. After a while, Alex H departs his lips and grabs my shoulders, forcing me to stare into his jet black eyes.)	game/script_hong.rpy	726	"[what]"

Alex_H_CH8_239a4a79	hong	Okay...why?	game/script_hong.rpy	885	hong "[what]"
Alex_H_CH8_a9c1d5b7	hong_mom	So you can see how DUMB you look. Go back to your room!	game/script_hong.rpy	886	hong_mom "[what]"
Alex_H_CH8_1ff4c319	hong	And thus, my parents raised me to be a Stakhanovite worker relating to academics.	game/script_hong.rpy	890	hong "[what]"
Alex_H_CH8_322418b5	hong	That treatment has boosted my grades, but as you can see, made me a failure at everything else.	game/script_hong.rpy	891	hong "[what]"
Alex_H_CH8_772f41c9	you	Don’t call yourself that, you’re not a failure.	game/script_hong.rpy	892	you "[what]"
Alex_H_CH8_4a2ca800	hong	So, prior to my last Calculus test, my parents had gotten quite enough of me, and were on the verge of sending me away to my grandparents back in Korea.	game/script_hong.rpy	895	hong "[what]"
Alex_H_CH8_9f07070c	hong	The education system there’s drastically different, and I’d need to go a few grades back to integrate into their school programs, for even a chance to do well on CSAT.	game/script_hong.rpy	897	hong "[what]"
Alex_H_CH8_fa768543	hong	Of course, I want to stay here. So I told them that if I can get above 95 on my next Calculus exam, I'll be able to stay here and they'll loosen their control over my life.	game/script_hong.rpy	898	hong "[what]"
Alex_H_CH8_bfaf4dc1	hong	If not, I would have to go back and suffer in Korea.	game/script_hong.rpy	899	hong "[what]"
Alex_H_CH8_fab7abd3	you	And, from your actions, I’m assuming you didn’t do well?	game/script_hong.rpy	900	you "[what]"
Alex_H_CH8_14e83963	hong	Not even, I got an 82. Not even an A, not even a PASS in my parents’ eyes. When they asked me, I couldn’t lie, they know everything. I told them about my 82.	game/script_hong.rpy	901	hong "[what]"
Alex_H_CH8_89974e19	you	And they told you to leave?	game/script_hong.rpy	902	you "[what]"
Alex_H_CH8_7bd441ad	hong	They revealed they knew I would fail, and had prepared a flight beforehand. It is supposed to leave tomorrow night. I didn’t want to go, so I...	game/script_hong.rpy	903	hong "[what]"
Alex_H_CH8_d676db80		(Alex H stopped his words, as tears began to well inside his eyes once more.)	game/script_hong.rpy	904	"[what]"
Alex_H_CH8_5303a023	you	So you decided that stepping off the edge of the earth was your best solution?	game/script_hong.rpy	905	you "[what]"
Alex_H_CH8_276d0439	hong	Yeah...	game/script_hong.rpy	906	hong "[what]"
Alex_H_CH8_54d92ff3		(An awkward silence gathers between us once more, as I decided not to say what I really wanted to say.)	game/script_hong.rpy	907	"[what]"
Alex_H_CH8_fb65adfb	hong	This morning they were reluctant to let me leave. I told them I would be out buying some souvenirs for my grandparents and they finally let me go. I don’t ever want to go back to Korea.	game/script_hong.rpy	908	hong "[what]"
Alex_H_CH8_9afde0b0		(I slowly pull Alex H into an embrace while patting his head as he slowly breaks down in tears.)	game/script_hong.rpy	909	"[what]"
Alex_H_CH8_0f105006	you	{i}Poor guy, having that much pressure mounted on you and being compared to your successful cousin eventually WILL take a toll on someone. I’m just glad I stopped him before he went too far.{i}	game/script_hong.rpy	910	you "[what]"
Alex_H_CH8_124298e4	you	So, if it’s alright with me asking, how do you want to proceed from here on?	game/script_hong.rpy	911	you "[what]"
Alex_H_CH8_2dca27b9		(Alex H slowly looks up at me with a confused expression.)	game/script_hong.rpy	912	"[what]"
Alex_H_CH8_b046f627	you	Do you want to run away from home? Or do you want to confront your parents and ask them to give you another chance?	game/script_hong.rpy	913	you "[what]"
Alex_H_CH8_c2222e76	hong	...	game/script_hong.rpy	914	hong "[what]"
Alex_H_CH8_e8d633c2	you	Think carefully, this decision will impact our actions and future drastically.	game/script_hong.rpy	915	you "[what]"
Alex_H_CH8_ca8102ba		(After a long pause, Alex H finally reaches an answer, and nods.)	game/script_hong.rpy	916	"[what]"
Alex_H_CH8_68a554f1	hong	As fun as running away might sound, I want to live a normal high school teenage life. I’m not ready to live by myself, on the run yet.	game/script_hong.rpy	917	hong "[what]"
Alex_H_CH8_9b743871	you	Okay, so you want to convince your parents to give you another chance. Any ideas for that yet?	game/script_hong.rpy	918	you "[what]"
Alex_H_CH8_265642b2	hong	No, not yet. I really don’t know. What if I do as bad on the second test?	game/script_hong.rpy	919	hong "[what]"
Alex_H_CH8_98abb895	you	Don’t worry, now that I know your situation, I’ll help you study Calculus. Back in my old school I was the top math student, and won all sorts of competitions!	game/script_hong.rpy	920	you "[what]"
Alex_H_CH8_8273cd25	hong	Are you sure? I’ve heard others from the school talk about how you were struggling in this and that.	game/script_hong.rpy	921	hong "[what]"
Alex_H_CH8_83f97ea0	you	Look, do lions ever concern themselves with the opinions of sheep? Do they? Of course not. So do you want my help or not?	game/script_hong.rpy	922	you "[what]"
Alex_H_CH8_e39d0aab		(With a menacing gaze, I stare at Alex H. He seems both surprised, frightened, and excited at the same time. I reach my hand out, waiting for him to accept it.)	game/script_hong.rpy	923	"[what]"

Alex_H_CH9_a7b8c4ef		(At last, the day of the dreaded test arrives. I walk with Alex H to the math classroom, where he, for the millionth time, checked for his graphing calculator.)	game/script_hong.rpy	963	"[what]"
Alex_H_CH9_8e3a1b7a		(This was it, his lifesaver, the test that will determine his future.)	game/script_hong.rpy	964	"[what]"
